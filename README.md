# PHP Education

This repository is keeping my PHP codes and folders. Also i want to say my customers and my employer 'I learned  PHP rules from zero to top '  with this repository meaning proof. üêò

## Why PHP?
First of all, i was know basic of PHP but that time when i was second year of college, i just want to have fun and never thinking be professional because it was fast to learn to do anything and was feeling cool make any website in that years.

PHP have huge opportunity to get a job, remote work and also get internship. So i decided learn PHP again but like a professional.

I think we shouldn't look what is the best of programming language. I think we should advance the developer ability and learn to use multi technology in one project. So keep try! üöÄ
